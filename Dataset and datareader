DataReader is used to fetch data from a database in a much faster way. 
Since the rows are fetched one at a time, load on the network will be low. 
Since DataReader is read only, transactions are not allowed. 
Since it support forward only data iteration, random data fetch is not supported.

DataSet is an in-memory representation of a table in a database. 
Dataset takes lot of application memory compared to DataReader. 
It is slower compared to DataReader. But user can do transactions using DataSet. It also support querying.
