Similar to reduce in Python

private static void Sample_Aggregate_Lambda_Simple()
{
    var numbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

    var result = numbers.Aggregate((a, b) => a * b);

    Debug.WriteLine("Aggregated numbers by multiplication:");
    Debug.WriteLine(result);
} Output:
Aggregated numbers by multiplication:
120

This Lambda Expression sample aggregates numbers in array by addition, using a seed (seed is an initial value).

private static void Sample_Aggregate_Lambda_Seed()
{
    var numbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };

    var result = numbers.Aggregate(10, (a, b) => a + b);

    Debug.WriteLine("Aggregated numbers by addition with a seed of 10:");
    Debug.WriteLine(result);
} Output:
Aggregated numbers by addition with a seed of 10:
16
