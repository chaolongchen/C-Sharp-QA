EXE

An exe always runs in its own address space i.e., It is a separate process.
The purpose of an EXE is to launch a separate application of its own.

DLL

A dll always needs a host exe to run. i.e., it can never run in its own address space.
The purpose of a DLL is to have a collection of methods/classes which can be re-used from some other application.
DLL is Microsoft's implementation of a shared library.
The file format of DLL and exe is essentially the same. Windows recognizes the difference between DLL and EXE through PE Header in the file.
