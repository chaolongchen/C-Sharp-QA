The architecture for enterprise application should have the following levels:

1. Entity Layer: Contains entities (POCOs)
2. Data Layer: Contains all code related to database access
3. Business Layer: Contains definitions and validations related to business
5. Services Layer (optional): Contains invocations for external services (ASMX, WCF, RESTful)
6. Common: Contains common classes and interfaces for all layers (e.g. Loggers, Mappers, Extensions)
7. Tests (QA): Contains automated tests
8. Presentation Layer: This is the UI
