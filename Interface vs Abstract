An interface merely declares a contract or a behavior that implementing classes should have. 
It may declare only properties, methods, and events with no access modifiers. 
All the declared members must be implemented.

An abstract class provides a partial implementation for a functionality 
and some abstract/virtual members that must be implemented by the inheriting entities. 
It can declare fields too.

Neither interfaces nor abstract classes can be instantiated.
