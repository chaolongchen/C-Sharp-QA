When methods are created with the same name, but with different signature its called overloading. 
For example, WriteLine method in console class is an example of overloading. 
In the first instance, it takes one variable. In the second instance, “WriteLine” method takes two variable.

Console.WriteLine(x);
Console.WriteLine("The message is {0}", Message);
Different types of overloading in C# are

Constructor overloading
Function overloading
